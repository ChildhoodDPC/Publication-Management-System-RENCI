# Project Title

RENCI Publication Management System

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Need Npm installed


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. This is hopefully only a few steps and easy to understand.

Say what the step will be

```
Npm Install
```
Use both commands to get React Frontend and Server Running.
```
Npm run client
```
```
Npm run server
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
